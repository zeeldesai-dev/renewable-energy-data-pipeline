# Design Decisions & Solution Rationale

## Core Architecture Decisions

### Event-Driven Serverless Pipeline
**Choice**: S3 → Lambda → DynamoDB → FastAPI
**Rationale**: Eliminates infrastructure management, provides automatic scaling, and optimizes costs within Free Tier constraints.

### Technology Selection
- **DynamoDB**: Chosen for sub-millisecond queries and on-demand billing vs. RDS fixed costs
- **Lambda**: Serverless execution vs. always-on EC2 instances for cost optimization
- **FastAPI**: Async support and automatic documentation vs. Flask simplicity

## Component Design Decisions

### Data Generation Strategy
- **Dual Generators**: `data_generator.py` for single-batch testing, `continuous_uploader.py` for production simulation
- **Safety Limits**: Maximum batch counts prevent runaway AWS costs
- **Realistic Patterns**: Time-based solar generation cycles for authentic testing scenarios

### Lambda Processing
- **File**: `lambda_processor.py` with comprehensive error handling
- **Design Choice**: Process entire JSON batches vs. individual records for efficiency
- **Memory/Timeout**: 256MB/30s optimized for typical 25-record batches

### API Architecture
- **Comprehensive Endpoints**: Beyond basic CRUD to include time-range filtering and anomaly analysis
- **Design Pattern**: RESTful with query parameters vs. GraphQL for simplicity
- **Validation**: Built-in FastAPI validation reduces error-prone manual checks

### Visualization Approach
- **Dual Purpose**: `energy_visualizer.py` for exploratory analysis, `business_visualizer.py` for executive reporting
- **Technology Choice**: Plotly HTML export vs. embedded dashboards for zero hosting costs
- **Business Focus**: Executive KPIs and efficiency metrics vs. raw technical charts

## Development & Testing Strategy

### Testing Scripts Implementation
- `test_error_handling.py`: Validates error management with simulated failures
- `test_github_check.py`: Verifies CI/CD configuration integrity
- `validate_terraform.py`: Infrastructure resource verification

**Rationale**: Independent component testing reduces integration debugging time.

### Infrastructure Approach
**Manual UI First**: AWS Console for rapid prototyping and immediate feedback
**Terraform Later**: Production-ready Infrastructure as Code for team collaboration

## Extended Functionality

### Extra Credit Features
1. **Real-Time Alerting**: SNS integration for immediate anomaly notification
2. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated deployment with security scanning
3. **Error Handling**: Production-grade reliability with retry mechanisms

### Business Value Additions
- **Executive Dashboards**: Business-focused visualizations for decision makers
- **Hybrid Development**: Practical approach balancing speed with best practices
- **Cost Optimization**: Maximum functionality within Free Tier constraints

## Conclusion

This solution demonstrates practical data engineering balancing rapid development with production readiness. The event-driven serverless architecture provides scalability while comprehensive testing ensures reliability.
